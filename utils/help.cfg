You get money from digging, but the terrain is lowered by one layer.

Eventually the hex will turn into chasm. This will kill the unit standing there, but give you +1 income.

You should never put a unit on cave terrain next to a harvester.

Self destructing a harvester destroys that hex and causes a chain reaction that also destroys connected cave terrain."
